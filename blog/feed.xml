    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year in September, we went to Barcelona for the first time. We spent two weeks in the most active neighborhood of the city.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always,  we were there for both remote working and visiting the city. Let's first talk about work first, then restaurants and places to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="coworking-at-mob"&gt;Coworking at MOB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a recommandation of friends living in Barcelona, we gave a try to &lt;a href="https://mob-barcelona.com/"&gt;MOB coworking&lt;/a&gt;  space. They have a few spaces in the city. We went to the one in Bailen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coworking is located in a building where there's also a caf√© and a fablab. The space has two floors with a few hotdesk and fixed desk areas, meeting rooms and phone booths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/coworking/mob-coworking-22faf459.jpg" alt="MOB coworking - Bailen" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/coworking/mob-coworking-meeting-room-d37fc44c.jpg" alt="MOB coworking, meeting room" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/coworking/mob-coworking-basement-246780b4.jpg" alt="MOB coworking, basement" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/coworking/mob-coworking-bailen-2e61ab4e.jpg" alt="MOB coworking, flex desks" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really liked our time at the coworking. Oh and the food and tea   from the caf√© were also really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="la-tartarera"&gt;La Tartarer√≠a&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of food, this restaurant, &lt;a href="http://www.latartareria.com/"&gt;La Tartarer√≠a&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ I can't describe it. It's such an experience. It's basically raw food, all kinds of raw food: from beef to veggies but the ingredients are magnified in such delicious flavors‚Ä¶ It was just incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/tartareria-smoked-beef-tartare-74cf36b3.jpg" alt="La Tartarer√≠a restaurant, Smoked beef tartare and potato waffle" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/tartareria-tuna-bluefin-tartare-4c92abae.jpg" alt="La Tartarer√≠a restaurant, Tuna Bluefin tartare, botarga and crispy rice wafer" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/tartareria-tuna-tartare-rice-wafer-2da42f8c.jpg" alt="La Tartarer√≠a restaurant, Crispy rice wafer and tuna tartare" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/tartareria-iberian-pork-tartare-146d16db.jpg" alt="La Tartarer√≠a restaurant, Iberian pork tartare and seasonal mushrooms" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that it's quite a pricey restaurant and my photos are yellow &amp;amp; ugly, yep üôà&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="parking-pita"&gt;Parking Pita&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum, meet &lt;a href="http://www.parkingpizza.com/index.php/eng/parking-pita-sant-joan-en"&gt;Parking Pita&lt;/a&gt;! A street food place located in what used to be a parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again the food was really good. I especially liked the shawarma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/parking-pita-entrance-f7468285.jpg" alt="Parking Pita, parking entrance" /&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/parking-pita-shawarma-pita-ab65c87e.jpg" alt="Parking Pita, shawarma pita" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/parking-pita-53e0fde4.jpg" alt="Parking Pita, a real parking place" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that on the other side of the parking, you'll find &lt;a href="http://www.parkingpizza.com/index.php/eng/parking-pizza-sant-joan-56-en"&gt;Parking Pizza&lt;/a&gt; üçï&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/parking-pizza-0ecc7cbe.jpg" alt="Parking Pizza, entrance" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/parking-pizza-street-food-30c7145b.jpg" alt="Parking Pizza" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="barri-gtic"&gt;Barri G√≤tic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, the Gothic neighborhood is one of the most amazing in Barcelona. Its architecture is beautiful, its small streets are so nice, the night life is‚Ä¶    overwhelming. Yes, it's a great neighborhood to visit or hang out but not to live in. Be warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/visits/barri-gotic-0bfaa6fc.jpg" alt="Barri G√≤tic district" /&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/visits/barri-gotic-choir-016292a9.jpg" alt="Barri G√≤tic, Pla√ßa del Rei" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/visits/barri-gotic-place-1a2cb481.jpg" alt="Barri G√≤tic, square" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing, we were hosted by a couple that runs a caf√© located right below the flat. We really enjoyed their food and tea (yep, there's always tea in life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-merce"&gt;The Merce&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of September, Catalonia celebrates the Merce, Saint Mercedes. During 5 days, there are events in all the city center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days were just crazy. There were so many people in the city üò±
All flats and rooms were booked and  packed. There was an event at every corner of the city center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/visits/merce-crowded-city-center-e0c89d37.jpg" alt="Merce celebration" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for us, we went to a street food event in the Gothic neighborhood. We enjoyed some red wine and tapas of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/visits/merce-born-festival-3681d564.jpg" alt="Merce BORN festival" /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cooking-workshop"&gt;Cooking workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also in Barcelona for the second retreat of the year of one of my clients. Among the activities we've done, my favorite one was definitely the &lt;a href="https://www.foodiexperiencebcn.com/"&gt;cooking workshop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned how to make a typical spanish / catalan menu with pan con tomato, paella, crema catalunia and sangria. That was a wonderful moment to share with the whole team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/fizzer-retreat/cooking-workshop-ingredients-ea9897f2.jpg" alt="Cooking workshop, Ingredients" /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fun-fact-japanese-food-lovers-"&gt;Fun Fact: Japanese food lovers üçú&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok that one, I didn't expect it.
Before arriving in Barcelona, we were in Amsterdam for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Amsterdam, we have our two favorite Japanese restaurants: &lt;a href="http://www.hakatasenpachi.com/"&gt;Hakata Senpachi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.umaimonramennoodle.nl/"&gt;Umaimon by Takumi&lt;/a&gt;.
Of course, during our one week stay, we went to both of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that, two days after our arrival in Barcelona, we went to a Japanese restaurant. Then we realised that all the decoration, cuttlery, porcelain, etc. looked familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were eating in one of the &lt;a href="https://sapporo.takumibarcelona.es/"&gt;Takumi restaurant&lt;/a&gt;'s of Barcelona üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/takumi-restaurant-63b1f957.jpg" alt="Takumi restaurant" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's it for our first time in Barcelona. We hope our friends will be in town next time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year in June we've been to Morocco for 2 weeks, half-time on holidays, half-time working, as usual üòú.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year in June we've been to Morocco for 2 weeks, half-time on holidays, half-time working, as usual üòú.
We spent 1 week in Marrakesh, then 1 week in Essaouira.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Essaouira, with C√©cile, we spent some relaxing time with a new nomad rider, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guicabanel"&gt;Guillaume&lt;/a&gt;.
We also spent 3 days with everyone working @ &lt;a href="https://www.lewagon.com/"&gt;Le Wagon&lt;/a&gt;, from all around the world, during an amazing retreat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy our list of top places to visit / work from / eat at in these two cities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="marrakesh"&gt;Marrakesh&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="gaa"&gt;üòãü•ó Ga√Øa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaia.marrakech/"&gt;Ga√Øa&lt;/a&gt; is a delicious restaurant to eat flavorful vegan food. Nice atmosphere, relaxing.
We did not work, but I'm pretty sure you can get some work done there if you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/marrakesh/gaia-cafe-fd10bc90.jpg" alt="Gaia caf√©" /&gt;

&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/marrakesh/gaia-restaurant-b121aebb.jpg" alt="Gaia restaurant" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="le-jardin-secret"&gt;üòªüå¥ Le Jardin Secret&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hidden gem to visit. You'll find &lt;a href="https://lejardinsecretmarrakech.com/en/"&gt;Le Jardin Secret&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of the Souk, behind a tall wall.
A breathtaking place, divided between two gardens: exotic and arabic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/marrakesh/jardin-secret-entrance-81b2f468.jpg" alt="Etrance of Le Jardin Secret" /&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/marrakesh/jardin-secret-arabic-garden-b408df84.jpg" alt="Arabic garden of Le Jardin Secret" /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-spot"&gt;üë©‚Äçüíªüìö The Spot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coworking spot of our stay in Marrakesh!
&lt;a href="http://www.thespot.ma/"&gt;The Spot&lt;/a&gt; is nicely organised and welcoming. And cheap as hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/marrakesh/the-spot-coworking-9681e5e3.jpg" alt="The spot coworking, Marrakesh" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/marrakesh/the-spot-coworking-bookshelf-084ff760.jpg" alt="The spot coworking, bookshelf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="les-bains-de-marrakech"&gt;üõÄüíÜ Les Bains de Marrakech&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent 3 hours in &lt;a href="http://www.lesbainsdemarrakech.com/en/photo-gallery"&gt;Les Bains de Marrakech&lt;/a&gt;, felt like a neverending paradise: petals &amp;amp; mud bath, followed by a 1h full-body massage.
Concluding with a mint tea and arabic cookies in a dim-lighted, indoors yard. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/marrakesh/les-bains-de-marrakech-9a95713b.jpg" alt="Les bains de Marrakech" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="essaouira"&gt;Essaouira&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="our-le-wagon-riad-lalla-zina"&gt;üõåüè° Our Le Wagon riad: Lalla Zina&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in Rue d'Agadir, near one of the main street of Essaouira, we had a really pleasant stay in this riad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rooms were simple but nice to sleep in.
We also had amazing arabic breakfasts: moroccan crepes, olives, peanut sauce freshly grinded, one of Essaouira specialty, and orange &amp;amp; carot freshly pressed juice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/lalla-zina-riad-aad4b527.jpg" alt="Lalla Zina riad" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/lalla-zina-bedroom-9be77233.jpg" alt="Lalla Zina, bedroom" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only downside: there was too much humidity in the bathroom, causing mold to develop near the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="triskala"&gt;üòãüêü Triskala&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/triskalaessaouira/"&gt;Triskala&lt;/a&gt; is the place you need to go to eat fish and locally sourced ingredients, where the menu changes every day, depending on the day's catch and produce, prepared following local and packed-with-flavors recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One revealing anecdote: if you ask for tap water, they'll serve you water filtered in a homemade terra cotta jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="latelier"&gt;üë©‚ÄçüíªüçÆ L'Atelier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lAtelierEssaouira/"&gt;L'Atelier&lt;/a&gt; was the working spot of our stay in Essaouira! Fresh &amp;amp; relaxing.
Amazing food and drinks as well. We spent two days there, working and eating all day long.
Make sure to try out the raspberry or cherry clafoutis, and their amazing, squeezed-on-demand juices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/atelier-181c56ff.jpg" alt="L'Atelier" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/atelier-clafoutis-c1fa4263.jpg" alt="L'Atelier, clafoutis" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="miyame"&gt;üòãü•ò miyame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down-to-earth restaurant, always packed with people, proving the quality of their cooking.
You'll be able to enjoy a nice tajine there and some pretty good samoussas.
And if you still have some room for dessert, I urge you to taste the homemade apple pie.
Personally, I ordered a slice, then immediately ordered a second üòä&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sunset-on-the-bulwarks"&gt;üåÖüè∞ Sunset on the bulwarks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One beautiful moment. We enjoyed some music played by a group of hippies, and saw the sun setting over the sea.
Just beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be warned though, as soon as the sunset begins, guards will start pushing people to exit the bulwarks. We actually had to play a cat &amp;amp; mouse game with them in order to enjoy the sunset. But it was quite fun to watch as well, because people were not really willing to move (especially the aforementioned music-playing hippies üòÅ)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/sunset-on-the-walls-86209137.jpg" alt="Sunset on the walls of Essaouira" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/sunset-fb88cbb7.jpg" alt="Sunset on the fortifications of Essaouira" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/sunset-on-the-sea-1407343a.jpg" alt="Sunset above the sea" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2019-07-14-morocco/essaouira/sunset-on-the-city-1ecbad38.jpg" alt="Sunset on Essaouira" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I'd say I enjoyed Essaouira more than Marrakesh.
One of the reason was the difference in weather: really too hot for me in Marrakesh, while in Essaouira we constantly had cooling winds blowing from the sea.
Another reason was more personal: I simply found Essouira more charming ‚ò∫Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time I stayed a few days in Warsaw with Thomas and we visited our friend Mateusz. This time, while still visiting my friend in Warsaw, I decided to spend a little bit more time in Wroclaw and go to a new city, Krakow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wroclaw"&gt;Wroclaw&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it started to snow a lot just when we arrived. We, yes, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/n_filzi"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; was there too, of course! Well, I'm not really used to really cold temperatures below zero (we've got -12 degrees on the &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/what-is-accuweather-realfeel/7198202"&gt;RealFeel scale&lt;/a&gt;!). So we tried to limit our outings as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we enjoyed an incredible view of Wroclaw under the snow. It's was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/wroclaw/wroclaw-under-the-snow-44824e96.jpg" alt="Wroclaw under the snow" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough talking, apart from the conference, we also worked a bit during our stay. Our main working spot was the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/KawalerkaCafe/"&gt;Kawalerka Caf√©&lt;/a&gt;. It's a nice retro like caf√©. I like the details in the decoration and furniture. Oh and their white tea is delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/wroclaw/kawalerka-cafe-7b54c52f.jpg" alt="Kawalerka caf√©, Wroclaw" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/wroclaw/kawalerka-white-tea-2a66eeb1.jpg" alt="White tea at Kawalerka" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the chance to leave the city on a beautiful sunny day. So we took some time to visit the city center before continuing our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/wroclaw/wroclaw-city-center-a79b6ab2.jpg" alt="City center of Wroclaw" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="krakow"&gt;Krakow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="kazimierz"&gt;Kazimierz&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed only a few days in Krakow and taking into account its size, it's not enough.
So we focused on exploring our neighborhood, Kazimierz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our housing was really well located. So well that we were staying just in front of a street food market and &lt;a href="http://starazajezdniakrakow.pl/"&gt;Stara Zajezdnia&lt;/a&gt;, a micro brewery hidden in an old tram depot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/krakow/krakow-street-food-market-9ec3ddbc.jpg" alt="Street food market in Krakow" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could enjoy nice local beers, try a polish style pulled-pork sandwich, or even go for a ramen and get some Hungarian sweet bread as desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And YES! We tried the famous zapiekanka. In France, when it is late in the night, people go for a kebab. Zapiekanka could be considered as the de facto polish late night junk food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/krakow/zapiekanka-store-ba4a154d.jpg" alt="Store selling zapiekanka in Kazimierz" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/krakow/zapiekanka-d7efcb83.jpg" alt="Two beautiful zapiekanka" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="working"&gt;Working&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When time came to work, we went to a coworking space that was literally 10 minutes away from our home. It's called &lt;a href="http://www.milkstudio.com.pl/"&gt;Milk coworking and photo studio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in an old building in the Szeroka street, on the opposite side of the old synagogue, the space is bright and offers a few desks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/krakow/milk-coworking-d9eb20f9.jpg" alt="Milk Coworking and photo studio" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I could regret is the fact that the manager is not here all day long. She came especially to show us the space in the morning and then came back at the end of the day to get our payment done. Thus there were no bounding between people. We were just people working in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/krakow/milk-coworknig-couch-8509fd4d.jpg" alt="Small couch at Milk Coworking" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/krakow/milk-coworking-drawings-3688f75c.jpg" alt="Drawings hanging on the wall of Milk Coworking" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest, we worked from home. The flat was really nice, offering a view on a sunny sky and we could play music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="visiting"&gt;Visiting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also dedicated some time to visit the city. Since we didn't have much time, we visited our neighborhood and the old city center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We joined two walking tours. One was focused on the Jewish history and the other one about the history of the city itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-06-15-poland/krakow/krakow-city-center-06d7327e.jpg" alt="City center of Krakow" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, for sure, that wasn't enough to really discover Krakow. We might come back sooner or later!&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2020-02-09T00:07:09+01:00</updated>
    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last January, with &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/n_filzi"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt;, we went to Cape Town, South Africa for one full month. What to say? It was truly amazing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last January, with &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/n_filzi"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt;, we went to Cape Town, South Africa for one full month. What to say? It was truly amazing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, we left France with its 5 degrees and cloudy weather, and landed in another hemisphere with 27 degrees! What else?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="visits"&gt;Visits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, we splitted our time between work and visits. With such an exotic country, I want to start telling you about our visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-must-see"&gt;The must see&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First time here, we had to go for the classics. I'll name a few here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Table Mountain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Robben island&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;District 6 museum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kirstenbosch botanical garden&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cape of Good Hope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/visits/district-6-museum-32acbde4.jpg" alt="District 6 museum, Cape Town" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/visits/kirstenbosch-botanical-garden-28bde44a.jpg" alt="Kirstenbosch botanical garden, Cape Town" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/visits/cape-of-good-hope-reserve-45dc4ebe.jpg" alt="Cape of Good Hope reserve" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/visits/cape-of-good-hope-b46498f0.jpg" alt="Cape of Good Hope area" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that the Table Mountain was the most impressive to me. It's really something to live in a city surrounded by the ocean on one side and by a masive and flat mountain on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also loved to see the weather changing around the mountain. The fog sliding down the side of the moutain is particularly spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/the-city/foggy-table-mountain-2a982fdd.jpg" alt="Foggy Table mountain, seen from the street" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/the-city/fog-on-table-mountain-b007df85.jpg" alt="Fog on Table mountain, seen from the highway" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-neighborhoods"&gt;The neighborhoods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the main sightseeing spots, the city has a lot more to offer. Each neighborhood has its own identity and atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked these ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;City bowl&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bo-Kaap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Woodstock&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/the-city/bo-kaap-neighborhood-05e56f01.jpg" alt="Bo-Kaap, Cape Town" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special mention to Woodstock where we stayed for the month!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things to see there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of graffs in the streets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Old Biscuit Mill market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://superette.co.za/"&gt;Superette&lt;/a&gt; (good food)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sorbetiere.co.za/"&gt;Sorbetiere&lt;/a&gt; (delicious ice creams)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/the-city/woodstock-graffs-a225391a.jpg" alt="Graffs in Woodstock, Cape Town" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/the-city/old-biscuit-mill-market-eaef2351.jpg" alt="Old Biscuit Mill Market, Woodstock, Cape Town" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="coworkings"&gt;Coworkings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to get some work done. A few things are different here and one of these is the Internet. It's not that easy to get a good connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to work from caf√©s but the connection wasn't that stable. It could work for few hours and suddenly stop working. So this time, we opted for coworking spaces only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried two spaces in two different areas of Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="greenpoint-coworking"&gt;Greenpoint coworking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we tried &lt;a href="http://www.greenpointcoworking.co.za/"&gt;Greenpoint coworking&lt;/a&gt;. As its name says, it is located in Greenpoint neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a big space with a mezzanine, located on the last floor of a huge business building. There are hotdesks, fixed desks, meeting rooms, a few phone boxes and a comfy area with a kitchen, sofa, gaming console and books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space was really nice. One thing though, the hotdesks are in front of a huge window. Problem is that starting at 15:00 the sun is right in front of it. At the end of the day, it was quite annoying. That's too bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/coworkings/greenpoint-coworking-hotdesks-2869ac01.jpg" alt="Hotdesks at Greenpoint coworking" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/coworkings/greenpoint-coworking-fixed-desks-f15844a6.jpg" alt="Fixed desks at Greenpoint coworking" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="spin-street-house"&gt;Spin Street House&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second coworking we tried is &lt;a href="http://spinstreet.co/"&gt;Spin Street House&lt;/a&gt; (they are currently in the process of renaming it into Seedspace). It's located in the City Bowl, a few blocks away from the famous Long street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space is composed of four floors. One floor offers an open space for hotdesking, a comfy area and a separate room for the kitchen. The other floors have dedicated desks and private office suites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in the city bowl, the space is quite active and offers a lot of side activities all the week long such as lunch all together, networking events, ping-pong &amp;amp; beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated working from this coworking space. I felt at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/coworkings/spin-street-house-hotdesks-065a0145.jpg" alt="Hotdesks at Spin Street House coworking" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/coworkings/spin-street-house-6b6cb26c.jpg" alt="Spin Street House coworking" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/coworkings/spin-street-house-kitchen-95c3e8a1.jpg" alt="Kitchen of Spin Street House" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/coworkings/spin-street-house-events-543733f8.jpg" alt="Events at Spin Street House" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="food"&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as foodies, we couldn't go that far and not talk about food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerky"&gt;beef jerky&lt;/a&gt; lover, I couldn't be happier when I discovered South Africa has its own dried meat called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biltong"&gt;Biltong&lt;/a&gt;. Oh and as a tea lover, I fell in love with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooibos"&gt;Rooibos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we also tried the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobotie"&gt;Bobotie&lt;/a&gt;. It's really good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/food/bobotie-fdc0507b.jpg" alt="Bobotie" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that salty food, you might want something sweeter. We opted for &lt;a href="http://sorbetiere.co.za/"&gt;Sorbetiere&lt;/a&gt;, a nice shop offering ice creams and sorbets, owned by an acquaintance. I enjoyed the stracciatella, mango and lemon flavors &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One special mention to &lt;a href="https://www.ashrestaurant.co.za/"&gt;ASH&lt;/a&gt; restaurant. The food is just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/food/ash-starter-2b8f8325.jpg" alt="ASH restaurant, Cape Town" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/food/ash-beef-b143d9e6.jpg" alt="Delicious beef at AHSH restaurant" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="saving-water"&gt;Saving water&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in the Cape region for one month, we couldn't ignore the fact that there's a major ongoing water crisis. When we arrived, the level 6 of &lt;a href="http://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/residential-utility-services/residential-water-and-sanitation-services/make-water-saving-a-way-of-life"&gt;water restrictions&lt;/a&gt; was operational, meaning we could use maximum 87L per person per day of municipal water. One month later, it was adjusted to level 6b and dropped to 50L a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tried to do our best in saving as much water as we could. Among other things, it included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using grey water for toilets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using water just to quickly rinse our hands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Washing dishes once a day and saving water while cooking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Washing our clothes only once during our stay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the well known incentive: "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/cape-town-think-water-561bd5d6.jpg" alt="Think Water campaign" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they will be able to fix the problem and be safe for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="final-boss-shosholoza-meyl"&gt;[FINAL BOSS] Shosholoza meyl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Shosholoza meyl, "a pleasant experience".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's one last thing I'd like to talk about, the &lt;a href="http://www.shosholozameyl.co.za/"&gt;Shosholoza meyl&lt;/a&gt;. It's a train that goes from Cape Town to Johannesburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the train and like their slogan says, it was kind of a pleasant journey. It goes through the whole country. It's 1400 km of different landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/train/shosholoza-meyl-train-a64130fc.jpg" alt="Shosholoza Meyl train" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/train/shosholoza-line-green-field-a64179bb.jpg" alt="Green field in the middle of South Africa, Shosohloza Meyl" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/train/shosholoza-blond-field-e2a40ee3.jpg" alt="Blond field along the Shosholoza Meyl train" /&gt;
&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-29-cape-town/train/chilling-in-shosholoza-meyl-e84b35f2.jpg" alt="Chilling in the Shosholoza Meyl train" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just know one thing, it can be slow, arrive really late (5 hours late for us!) or it can just stop in the middle of South to because the track is closed and you end up finishing the trip in a bus. That could also be part of the journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seriously, don't get bothered by what I just said.
Take the train, sleep in it and just enjoy the slow ride. In the end I loved this train journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you soon for more adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little bit of context first: &lt;a href="http://cecilitse.org/"&gt;C√©cile&lt;/a&gt; and I went to Budapest in September 2017, for a tech conference.
Other people joined us on our discovery of the city. Budapest is incredible. We enjoyed the food, the coffee places, and more poetically the feelings of beauty and grandiosity the city was offering us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buuuuut in the mean time, we also had to get some work done!
So here it comes! A list of places we recommend (or not!) if you want ‚Ä¶ to get some work done üò¨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cafs"&gt;Caf√©s&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="d18"&gt;D18&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://d18.hu/"&gt;D18&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty nice caf√©, but with a shitty wifi. Seriously bad. I had to use my phone data plan,
then we just decided to go elsewhere.
Food is pretty good though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-19-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-budapest/d18-cafe-ac1168e1.jpg" alt="D18 Caf√©" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="california-coffee-company"&gt;California Coffee Company&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://californiacoffeeco.net/"&gt;California Coffee Company&lt;/a&gt; is a decent place, with lots of space. But it's a chain (hipster rant coming in!). But still, it's nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-19-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-budapest/california-coffee-company-6ba27e78.jpg" alt="California Coffee Company" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="magveto-caf"&gt;Magveto Caf√©&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BEST place we went to&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="http://cafe.magveto.hu/"&gt;Magveto Caf√©&lt;/a&gt; has an amazing atmosphere, the food and tea were awesome.
Definitely go there. We spent two afternoons there. That's how we liked it üëç&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2018-03-19-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-budapest/magveto-cafe-84b8a8e7.jpg" alt="Magveta Caf√©" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="coworkings"&gt;Coworkings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kaptarbudapest.hu/"&gt;Kaptar&lt;/a&gt; is a super nice coworking. Bright, lots of light, nice snacks, good wifi, good organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="new-work-labs"&gt;New Work Labs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[BAD style]&lt;/strong&gt; Don't go there, except if you really have no other choice.
It's &lt;strong&gt;not a coworking space&lt;/strong&gt;. There's only one room, with a big ass table sitting in the center.
It's a pain in the ass to register to. Like 4-5 pages üí© form requiring personal info for no reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-hub--loffice"&gt;The Hub &amp;amp; LOffice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not convinced? Few years ago, C√©cile also tried &lt;a href="http://thehub.hu/"&gt;The Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://loffice.hu/"&gt;LOffice&lt;/a&gt;. They are also pretty nice. Note that LOffice has also a caf√© on the rooftop of their building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs all folks! I hope you‚Äôll hit these places up and enjoy them as much as we did!
Let us know if you did üòâ&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It had been about six months since the great success of our previous &lt;a href="blog/2016-12-20-ireland.html"&gt;remote-working trip in Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. During that trip we took the 'remote' part of remote-working very seriously, having rented an annex to a farm in the middle of nowhere - surrounded by sheep.
Personally I was happily surprised by how well a holiday of sorts could be combined with working on the things you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides work we naturally spent ample time exploring the area and the beautiful nature there. Every meal was amazing as almost all of us love cooking and we took great care in preparing nice and interesting food. We returned to our own corners of the world, well-fed and with a refreshingly empty to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-veluwe"&gt;The Veluwe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came together again online and spent some weeks discussing a new trip. At first we had our sights set on Geneva but in the end our existing travel schedules led us to choose a location in the Netherlands. We decided to go to the Veluwe. A large and beautiful forest area in the centre of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-23-veluwe/hoge-veluwe-lars-1eb3ff7c.jpg" alt="Tree in Putten" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went for a total of six days, of which we were joined by &lt;a href="https://jadjoubran.io/"&gt;Jad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nicolesaidy.com/"&gt;Nicole&lt;/a&gt; for the first four and by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/n_filzi"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; for the last two. Me and &lt;a href="http://cecilitse.org/"&gt;Cecile&lt;/a&gt; were present the entire stretch of time. I borrowed a car and picked up Jad and Nicole in Haarlem, where they were staying for a month. Then we continued to pick up Cecile in Amsterdam. The Netherlands are quite densely populated so as we were driving we didn't gradually merge into an area with an abundance of nature, instead flats and business areas turned to farms interspersed with tiny villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-edge-of-the-forest"&gt;The edge of the forest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the location, which was a park of vacation homes near the edge of the forest. We quickly settled in and went to the nearest village for a quick bite and some groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the week progressed we went about our usual business, Cecile being busy preparing an application for a high-traffic launch. Jad working on editing and filming online coding tutorials and Nicole working on several proposals for new clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-23-veluwe/all-working-be8a73ab.jpg" alt="Everyone working" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-23-veluwe/work-from-outside-fecc4c17.jpg" alt="Jad working from outside" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each morning I went for a run in the adjacent woods, massive and beautiful. I got lost there the first time. I assumed the pathways throughout the woods were laid out as a grid but it turned out to be circular, all leading to one central point in the middle. In the end it was a really nice experience, I just sat down for a while and enjoyed the lack of pressure to find my way back to civilization. I had no appointments, no deadlines. The only thing I had to keep in mind was to be back before dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went into the forest as a group twice to just wander about and be in nature before returning to whatever it was we were working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-23-veluwe/putten-forest-08c6c549.jpg" alt="Putten forest" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-hoge-veluwe-park"&gt;The Hoge Veluwe park&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the final day of our stay we took the car to a specific part of the woods, de Hoge Veluwe, where we rented a few bikes to ride around the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="c-blog-image--centered"&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-23-veluwe/hoge-veluwe-biking-abec5e8f.jpg" alt="Biking in the Hego Veluwe park" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we left the woods and returned to civilization. It was a satisfying experience, being on a work holiday in my own country and getting to spend some time in Dutch nature.&lt;/p&gt;
