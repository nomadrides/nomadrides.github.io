        | Hey there! I'm Cecile Veneziani, a freelancer from North of France.
      p
        | This project started with a simple observation:
          since I'm a remote freelancer, I can work from any place that has a network connection.
          So my plan is to travel, visit and work at the same time.

        | This website aggregates all my work-travels, the ones from the people
          I've met and tomorrow yours.
          Feel free to contact me if you want to join the next ride.
          Even better, propose our next ride!
