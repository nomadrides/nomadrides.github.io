So yep, with Nicolas, we've been to Japan and we've used some of our time to work a bit. [Nicolas](https://twitter.com/n_filzi) wrote an article about [how we've travelled through Japan while working](/blog/2017-09-28-japan.html). As a follow up, I propose here a listing of all the places we've worked from.

Some of the places that I'm going to list don't have any wifi connection but we didn't care because we had a **Pocket Wifi**. So if you go to Japan, make sure to get one.

## Tokyo

### Coworking Impact Hub

      <li>Always provide iced tea</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

We worked at [Impact Hub](https://hubtokyo.com/) coworking for one month. It's a great place to work from and it's really well located. It's a few minutes away from the Meguro river, a nice spot to have a break or just enjoy Hanami (provided you're there in April!).

### Café Today is my life!

      <li>Cozy place</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

We stayed one afternoon at [Today is my life!](http://chikyu-tabi-cafe.com/) café. It's a nice café with an amazing decor and bathroom (you have to try it!). Actually, it was the perfect spot - cozy and relaxing - to prepare all my postcards for my family and friends.

Just one thing, be sure to leave the place before dinner's time in order to not bother them.

## Kyoto

### Coworking Oinai Karasuma

<div class="row c-blog-images">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-21-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-japan/kyoto/oinai-karasuma-coworking.jpg" alt="Oinai Karasuma - Lounge" class="c-blog-image--centered">

    <ul>
      <li>Website: <a href="http://oinai-karasuma.jp/">http://oinai-karasuma.jp/</a></li>
      <li>Good internet connection</li>

      <li>Staff does not really speak English (yet)</li>
      <li>Kindish remote workers friendly</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

We worked 2 days from [Oinai Karasuma](http://oinai-karasuma.jp/) coworking. Like mentionned above, the staff does not really speak English but they were always willing to help us. And there is always someone available in the building to do the translation. They are also not (yet) used to remote workers coming to work only for few days but they managed something for us.

Oh and we had an amazing lunch with the other coworkers, it was a homemade Pho soup!

### Café Kaikado

<div class="row c-blog-images">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-21-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-japan/kyoto/kaikado-cafe.jpg" alt="Kaikado café" class="c-blog-image--centered">

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <ul>
      <li>Website: <a href="http://www.kaikado-cafe.jp/">http://www.kaikado-cafe.jp/</a></li>
      <li>Really good tea & pastries</li>
      <li>Cozy</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

We didn't work from the [Kaikado](http://www.kaikado-cafe.jp/) café but it seemed to be a good place to work from. People around us were having some delicacies, reading books or working on some design project.

{:.c-blog-image--centered}

By the way, if you like cheesecakes, don't leave the place without trying it!

## Himeji

### Coworking Mocco

<div class="row c-blog-images">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-21-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-japan/himeji/mocco-coworking.jpg" alt="Mocco coworking, Himeji" class="c-blog-image--centered">

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <ul>
      <li>Website: <a href="http://moccomocco.net/">http://moccomocco.net/</a></li>
      <li>Good internet connection</li>
      <li>Open space area</li>
      <li>Free drinks</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

We didn't really expect to find a coworking space in Himeji. Well, yes, as tourists, we were there for the Castle! But since we had a few hours to kill before taking our train, we tried the [Mocco](http://moccomocco.net/) coworking space. It's nice and quiet, perfect to get some work done.

## Takayama

### Café Soeur

<div class="row c-blog-images">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-21-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-japan/takayama/cafe-soeur.jpg" alt="Café Soeur, Takayama" class="c-blog-image--centered">

      <li>Website: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/othellospcr/">https://www.facebook.com/othellospcr/</a></li>
      <li>Good internet connection</li>
      <li>Amazing iced tea & pastries</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Again, we didn't really expect to find a nice place to work from in Takayama. After all, it's quite a small city (compared to... well, Tokyo and Kyoto for instance) hidden somewhere in the mountains.

So, we've found the [Café Soeur](http://www.honmachi-2chome.jp/english/shop/31.html) and we've spent one afternoon working there. The place provides a nice view over the river, which is quite relaxing.

## Miyajima / Itsukushima (Hiroshima Bay)

### Café Itsuki Coffee

<div class="row c-blog-images">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-21-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-japan/myiajima/itsuki-coffee.jpg" alt="Itsuki Coffee" class="c-blog-image--centered">

      <li>No internet connection</li>
      <li>Touristic place</li>
      <li>Nice iced tea</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

If you're not familiar with Japan geography, Itsukushima is a small island located in the Hiroshima bay. The place is well known by tourists thanks to its Torii located in the water.

{:.c-blog-image--centered}
![Miyajima Torii](/assets/images/blog/articles/2017-10-21-coworking-spaces-and-cafes-in-japan/myiajima/miyajima-torii.jpg)

It's not that easy to find a suitable place to work from. Of course, there are no coworking spaces. After our visits of the torii, temple and pagodas, we've been to the [Itsuki Coffee](http://itsuki-miyajima.com/shop/itsuki_coffee/).

We went to the backroom to have more space, plugs and not disturb tourists. I wouldn't say it's the perfect place to work from but it does the job.

## Beppu

### Café Othello Specialty Coffee Roaster

<div class="row c-blog-images">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">

      <li>A large wooden table</li>
      <li>Really good coffee & good toasts</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

The place is quite small. There are a few small tables and a large wooden table. We worked from there for a few hours before leaving the city. It's a nice place.

Oh and the coffee smells really good. Too bad I don't like coffee.

## Naha, Okinawa

### Café T&M COFFEE

<div class="row c-blog-images">
  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">

      <li>Amazing tiramisu</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

That's already the end of the road, Okinawa, the last island we've been to. We've found the [T&M COFFEE](http://www.tmcoffee.jp/) on our way back from an amazing restaurant (more about this one below).

We went upstairs in order to enjoy a cozier and less loudy atmosphere but don't get fooled, the music is really nice, they have a good iced tea and a delicious tiramisu. We were in love with this place and spent 2 afternoons working from there.

One word about this amazing restaurant we've been to. It's called **Ganso Daito Soba**. They propose Daito soba soup for sure, but the best part is their **swordfish sushi**. You have to try that one too, it's delicious!

That's it. Hope you've found this list useful.
