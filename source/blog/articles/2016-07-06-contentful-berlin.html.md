Guten Tag! it’s David!

Currently, I work as a [Front-end engineering consultant](http://www.davidl.fr/) in Lille, France. Recently I was given the chance to visit the [contentful HQ](https://www.contentful.com/about-us/) in Berlin.
Four days to explore the city and meet the team. Plus an amazing mission: watch the match France vs Germany in incognito mode.

## Berlin — Capital of Germany

During my trip, I came across a lot of nice places just by walking. The weather was great! It would have been a shame not to enjoy the sun, all this made it easier to practice my favorite activity: __getting lost & dicovering new places__.

These are some of the places I liked in particular:
- Alexander Platz
- Berliner Dom
- The Chaos Computer Club
- Checkpoint Charlie
- Plenty of “straße”
- & Ampelmann Shop (Yes, in Berlin there are custom traffic light men)

## Meeting people: Agile Board Hacks at ThoughtWorks

This was my first time in Berlin. I'd like to meet new people, so what is the best way to do that? … I am a community leader of some meetups in Lille. Maybe I can find a nice meetup group in Berlin!

A few hours after landing I was at ThoughtWorks Werkstatt, an event host, for an event called [Agile Board Hacks](http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/ThoughtWorks-Berlin/events/232224931/).

Nick Thorpe presented examples of agile walls from his blog — [https://agileboardhacks.com](https://agileboardhacks.com) — where teams try to ship features faster or try to solve problems.

## 2 days at Contentful HQ

### about:contentful

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) has a mission: __avoid the web-focused CMSs__ — aka See As Mess systems. These systems are not a proper fit for the web in the 21st century — the web of mobile, interactive & multichannel content.

Instead contentful is a tool designed with developers in mind: it's an API with a focus on content.

- Developers are happy because it doesn't have a [bloated backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat)
- CMS addicts are happy because they can edit content on a web platform
- Businesses are happy because they have a [clear pricing page](https://www.contentful.com/pricing/)

_This is where the magic happens_

### Meeting the team

During the meeting I was able to talk with a lot of smart people who are involved in the product.

As a Chief Marketing Officer, Chris wants to facilitate multiple great user experience paths for Contentful. What if customers were allowed to have built-in solution? You push the famous big red button and — Bam! Your new website is online with an astonishing theme… Maybe they are working on it? #revelation #stayTunned

Artas is the Product Marketing Manager at Contentful, and one of the issues he works to solve is about __automation__. It’s funny because it reminds me one of my favorite quotes.

> Whatever you do, make sure you are __automating__, because if you aren’t, all you are doing is making it harder for yourself when you revisit the __problem__, and making it even harder for the next __person__ who will inevitably have to __reproduce__ your __solution__.
> <cite> Githuber at Puppet conf</cite>

I also met Eugene — Copywriter - & he shared an amazing website with me about Typography [typesetinthefuture.com](https://typesetinthefuture.com/).

But wait, it's lunch time!

After the lunch, I met Marko, Claus & Jan (Designer & developer).

We talked about how I code / organize atomic design systems like [patternlab](http://patternlab.io/). During the talk we discovered we're all obsessed with performance so we shared our favourite tools about image optimization :

- [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo): A nodejs-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files.

- [ImageOptim-CLI](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI): Automate the optimizations of images.

### Time to chill a bit

At the end of the day, I had a great time with the Kr3w: playing table tennis in the chilling zone.

Before leaving the team they offered me an amazing gift: the __goodies box__! What does it include?

- A coloring book
- A Rubik's Cube
- A bunch of stickers
- A Tshirt
- and …? and …? and …? Socks!
