This is it! I've assembled my new laptop setup.

Now that I've made a [comparison of the best keyboards and trackpads](/blog/2016-10-05-keyboards-and-trackpads-for-nomads.html) for people that travel, it was time to decide which devices will complete my setup.

## The keyboard

I've chosen the [Microsoft Universal Foldable Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/universal-foldable-keyboard/gu5-00001) because it's **foldable** and the most **lightweight** keyboard available with only 180g for 45-90€.

I've been using it for few weeks and for now, I can tell that keys are really soft, thus the touch experience is quite nice.

In the beginning, I had some trouble with the size of the keys (smaller than on my laptop), the space between them (no space in fact) and the layout: special keys (home, control, alt and fn) aren't in the same order as on my laptop.

In the end, I just got used to it. Now I'm perfectly fine and enjoy using the keyboard.

Mine is a Spanish keyboard just because I don't really care about the layout. I configured a [dvorak layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard).

## The trackpad

For the trackpad, I took the [Logitech T650 trackpad](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/touchpad-t650) for 70€. It's a bit bigger than I thought.

I was afraid to loose the USB dongle - it's really tiny - but I took the habit to always put it inside my laptop sleeve. We'll see if it works, otherwise I guess that next time I'll have to choose a trackpad I'll go for one with Bluetooth connectivity.

## The stand

Without much hesitation, I bought the [Roost stand](https://www.therooststand.com) for 70€. The funny thing is that within two days I was waiting to receive it, I met 4 people using it! I guess I've made the right choice.

What can I say? It's the most impressive part of my setup. **Ultra light** with only 165g and really **small**: folded, it's the size of my 13" laptop. I'm really happy with this piece that completes my setup.

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <p>Whenever I can, I take my <a href="http://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/store/ueboom2">UE Boom speaker</a> along with me. It's always nice to have some music while working.</p>
    <p>This speaker is a bit expensive (150€) and it might not be the best wireless speaker that is on the market. Thing is that at home, we have 2 of them so we can plug them together to have stereo.</p>

### Notebook

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <p>My setup wouldn't have been complete without a notebook. I don't have any preference here so each time I try a different one. For now, I have a <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/en/collections/model/product/ruled-soft-notebook-large">Moleskine Notebook</a> for 12€.</p>
    <p>Useful for any kind of notes: interview with a client, coaching session, tech design of web applications, TODO lists, etc.</p>

## Lugagge

Now let's talk about the luggage that carries everything.

### Backpack

For travels from **few days up to one week**, I just use a backpack. It's perfect, there's enough space for my laptop setup, a light towel and few clothes.

So nothing really fancy here. No [Tortuga backpack](http://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/tortuga-air-carry-on-backpack). I just recycled a cyclotourism backpack.

### New suitcase

For longer travels, **anything longer than few weeks** - I generally don't travel for long periods of time - I use a suitcase in combination with a smaller backpack.

You won't believe me, for more than 8 months, I traveled with a broken suitcase. The rear wheels were out of order so I had to carry my suitcase backwards. Turns out it's way more heavy this way! So I finally decided to end this torment. Here is my new suitcase!

{:.c-blog-image--centered}
![American Tourister - Bon Air, cabin suitcase](/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-11-14-laptop-setup/suitcase-american-tourister.jpg)

It's an [American Tourister Bon Air](http://www.americantourister.co.uk/bon-air/collection-en.htm). It's a low cost one. So for only 60€ you have this beautiful suitcase (available in a lot of colors). It's a cabin suitcase so you can take it in the cabin with you in almost all planes. And yes, I already pimped it!

## Your setup

What about you, what's your setup? Let me know, I'm super curious!
