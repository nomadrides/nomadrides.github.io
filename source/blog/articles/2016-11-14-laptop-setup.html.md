> **UPDATE 05/01/18** - I have a brand **new backpack**, a **new speaker** and icing on the cake, a **scanner** (no kidding)!

This is it! I've assembled my new laptop setup.

Now that I've made a [comparison of the best keyboards and trackpads](/blog/2016-10-05-keyboards-and-trackpads-for-nomads.html) for people that travel, it was time to decide which devices will complete my setup.

## The keyboard

I've chosen the [Microsoft Universal Foldable Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/universal-foldable-keyboard/gu5-00001) because it's **foldable** and the most **lightweight** keyboard available with only 180g for 45-90€.

I've been using it for few weeks and for now, I can tell that keys are really soft, thus the touch experience is quite nice.

In the beginning, I had some trouble with the size of the keys (smaller than on my laptop), the space between them (no space in fact) and the layout: special keys (home, control, alt and fn) aren't in the same order as on my laptop.

In the end, I just got used to it. Now I'm perfectly fine and enjoy using the keyboard.

Mine is a Spanish keyboard just because I don't really care about the layout. I configured a [dvorak layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard).

## The trackpad

For the trackpad, I took the [Logitech T650 trackpad](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/touchpad-t650) for 70€. It's a bit bigger than I thought.

I was afraid to loose the USB dongle - it's really tiny - but I took the habit to always put it inside my laptop sleeve. We'll see if it works, otherwise I guess that next time I'll have to choose a trackpad I'll go for one with Bluetooth connectivity.

## The stand

Without much hesitation, I bought the [Roost stand](https://www.therooststand.com) for 70€. The funny thing is that within two days I was waiting to receive it, I met 4 people using it! I guess I've made the right choice.

What can I say? It's the most impressive part of my setup. **Ultra light** with only 165g and really **small**: folded, it's the size of my 13" laptop. I'm really happy with this piece that completes my setup.

## Extra accessories

### Speaker

    </a>
  </div>

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <p>Whenever I can, I take my <a href="www.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/JBL+CLIP+2.html">JBL Clip 2 speaker</a> along with me. It's always nice to have some music while working.</p>
    <p>This speaker is quite affordable (50€) but for this price, it doesn't provide such an amazing sound. Nevertheless it's still good enough while travelling.</p>
  </div>
</div>

> **UPDATE 05/01/18** - I used to travel with a [UE Boom speaker](http://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/store/ueboom2) but it's really too heavy. So, I keep this one at home.

### Notebook

  </div>

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <p>My setup wouldn't have been complete without a notebook. I don't have any preference here so each time I try a different one. For now, I have a <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/en/collections/model/product/ruled-soft-notebook-large">Moleskine Notebook</a> for 12€.</p>
    <p>Useful for any kind of notes: interview with a client, coaching session, tech design of web applications, TODO lists, etc.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Scanner

No, that's not a joke. I really bought a portable scanner, the [Fujitsu ScanSnap IX100](http://www.fujitsu.com/uk/products/computing/peripheral/scanners/scansnap/ix100/). As freelancer, every month, I have to scan all my receipts.

{:.c-blog-image--centered}
![Scanner Fujitsu ScanSnap IX100](/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-11-14-laptop-setup/scanner-fujitsu-scan-snap-ix100.jpg)

I used to take pictures of my receipts with my smartphone but it took ages and the quality wasn't that good. Then I used the scanner from the coworking space where I usually work. But what happens when I travel and I do travel quite often...

This comes with a price (250€) but it's really worth it. It saves me so much time. I'm in love with this little device.

## Lugagge

Now let's talk about the luggage that carries everything.

### Backpack

> **UPDATE 05/01/18** - I used to switch between a small backpack and a cyclotourism backpack. It turned out that it was not optimal nor comfortable at all. So I bought a new one.

For travels from **a few days up to one week**, I just use a backpack. It's perfect, there's enough space for my laptop setup, a light towel and a few clothes.

Using a random backpack, I started to feel a pain in my back during travels. So after one year with my new setup, it was time to upgrade this part too. I took the quite famous [Bobby backpack](https://www.xd-design.com/bobby-anti-theft-backpack-grey).

{:.c-blog-image--centered}
![Bobby backpack](/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-11-14-laptop-setup/bobby-backpack.jpg)

If you don't know it yet, it's an **anti-theft** backpack but I haven't bought it for this purpose. I bought it because it's supposed to **optimise weight balance** by 20% and it works well.

  </div>

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
    <p>On a side note, I think the <a href="https://www.xd-design.com/bobby-backpack/bobby-compact-diver-blue">Bobby Compact</a> version is a better fit for smaller people like me, even thought I've chosen the big one. It like to put a lot of stuff inside my backpack!</p>

### New suitcase

For longer travels, **anything longer than a few weeks** - I generally don't travel for long periods of time - I use a suitcase in combination with my backpack.

You won't believe me, for more than 8 months, I traveled with a broken suitcase. The rear wheels were out of order so I had to carry my suitcase backwards. Turns out it's way more heavy this way! So I finally decided to end this torment. Here is my new suitcase!

{:.c-blog-image--centered}
![American Tourister - Bon Air, cabin suitcase](/assets/images/blog/articles/2016-11-14-laptop-setup/suitcase-american-tourister.jpg)

It's an [American Tourister Bon Air](http://www.americantourister.co.uk/bon-air/collection-en.htm). It's a low cost one. So for only 60€ you have this beautiful suitcase (available in a lot of colors). It's a cabin suitcase so you can take it in the cabin with you in almost all planes. And yes, I already pimped it!

## Your setup

What about you, what's your setup? Let me know, I'm super curious!
