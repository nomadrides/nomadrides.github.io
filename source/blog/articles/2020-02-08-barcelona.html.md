Last year in September, we went to Barcelona for the first time. We spent two weeks in the most active neighborhood of the city.

As always,  we were there for both remote working and visiting the city. Let's first talk about work first, then restaurants and places to visit.

## Coworking at MOB

From a recommandation of friends living in Barcelona, we gave a try to [MOB coworking](https://mob-barcelona.com/)  space. They have a few spaces in the city. We went to the one in Bailen.

The coworking is located in a building where there's also a caf√© and a fablab. The space has two floors with a few hotdesk and fixed desk areas, meeting rooms and phone booths.

We really liked our time at the coworking. Oh and the food and tea   from the caf√© were also really good.

## La Tartarer√≠a

Speaking of food, this restaurant, [La Tartarer√≠a](http://www.latartareria.com/)... I can't describe it. It's such an experience. It's basically raw food, all kinds of raw food: from beef to veggies but the ingredients are magnified in such delicious flavors... It was just incredible.

Note that it's quite a pricey restaurant and my photos are yellow & ugly, yep üôà

## Parking Pita

On the other side of the spectrum, meet [Parking Pita](http://www.parkingpizza.com/index.php/eng/parking-pita-sant-joan-en)! A street food place located in what used to be a parking lot.

Again the food was really good. I especially liked the shawarma.

## Barri G√≤tic

For sure, the Gothic quarter is one of the most amazing neighborhoods of Barcelona. Its architecture is beautiful, its small streets are so nice, the night life is...    overwhelming. Yes, it's a great neighborhood to visit or hang out but it's not the perfect quarter to live. Be warned.

One nice thing, we were hosted by a couple that runs a caf√© located right below the flat. We really enjoyed their food and tea (yep, there's always tea in life).

## The Merce

At the end of September, Catalonia celebrates the Merce, Saint Mercedes. During 5 days, there are events in all the city center.

These days were just crazy. There were so many people in the city. All flats and rooms were booked and  packed üò±. There was an event at every corner of the city center.

{:.c-blog-image--centered}

As for us, we went to a street food event in the Gothic Quarter. We enjoyed some red wine and tapas of course!

## Cooking workshop

I was also in Barcelona for the second retreat of the year of one of my clients. Among the activities we've done, my favorite one was definitely the [cooking workshop](https://www.foodiexperiencebcn.com/).

We learned how to make a typical spanish / catalan menu with pan con tomato, paella, crema catalunia and sangria. That was a wonderful moment to share with the whole team.

## Fun Fact: Japanese food lovers üçú

Ok that one, I didn't expect it.
Before arriving in Barcelona, we were in Amsterdam for a week.

In Amsterdam, we have our two favorite Japanese restaurants: [Hakata Senpachi](http://www.hakatasenpachi.com/) and [Umaimon by Takumi](https://www.umaimonramennoodle.nl/).
Of course, during our one week stay, we went to both of them.

The funny thing is that, two days after our arrival in Barcelona, we went to a Japanese restaurant. Then we realised that all the decoration, cuttlery, porcelain, etc. looked familiar.

We were eating in one of the [Takumi restaurant](https://sapporo.takumibarcelona.es/)'s of Barcelona üòÇ

{:.c-blog-image--centered}

![Takumi restaurant, Curry and gyoza](/assets/images/blog/articles/2020-02-08-barcelona/food/takumi-curry-and-gyoza.jpg)

That's it for our first time in Barcelona. We hope our friends will be in town next time.
