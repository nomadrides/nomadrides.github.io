The summer was here yet the clouds decided to stay in Lille, so it was
time to take off to... Portugal!!

A friend of mine was born in Peniche and as a lover of everything that
can glide (please...), with surf coming in my top-3 list, I was getting
an opportunity to meet the tide of this famous area, in incredible
conditions.

## Peniche

A little background, Peniche is located in the south of Portugal and is
known for its famous spots:

  - Baleal that used to be a very small island is now crowded with
surfers and surf schools and is no longer an island. They connected
it to the lands with sand.

 - Supertubos where an international surf competition takes place every
   year and where the most famous international surfers meet to defy one
   of the biggest wave in the world.

So, as you can guess, it was easy to trade my longboard for a surf!

Cécile, Hervé, Tiphaine and Greg from [La Coroutine](http://lacoroutine.org/) joined the adventure.
After a long journey by car, plane, metro, bus and taxi... we finally arrived.

## Working & Surfing

To give you a big picture, our days where very tiring. Yeah, so hard such as enjoying a
cocktail behind a veranda, facing the sea while working on the
computer. I found watching the kites very relaxing while searching for
inspiration.

Beach and surf sessions eventually happened as soon as we
could, of course. I discovered marine longboarding also ‒ a very long
board that let you ride for a long time espescially when the tide is
low. You can walk on it, jump, even make figures if you're feeling
lucky.

We also rented bikes, longboarded from Baleal to Peniche, enjoyed a few
BBQs, played Mölkky, discovered the famous portuguese chocolate
saucisson and tasted awesome shrimps cooked with a whisky sauce.

## Visiting Lisbon

After a few days, we moved to Lisbon. We discovered this city and its
typical areas. It's really beautiful, mixing old and new styles of
different centuries. There are a zillion of small restaurants, cafes and
bars where you can hang and just enjoy life.

## Fun facts & Hints

### The Castle Area

I, nevertheless, managed to hurt myself. I was so enjoying a
lonnnng wave that I forgot to jump before reaching the reef. In a
fraction of time, I looked at the sea, noticed a deep dark colour
underneath and shouted VERY strongly in my head a very simple word:
"FUCK". I had to choose between jumping on the rocks and hurting my feet
or breaking the board.

Well, it seems like my brain decided my feet
where cheaper than a surfboard and so decided to jump. If that matters,
it wasn't rocks. Well, to be fair: not *only* rocks. They were
urchins. Motherfucking urchins. Now my feet were ruined.

The day later, we decided to rent Stand Up Paddles (SUP). The guy told
us "if you don't want to ruin your holidays, just avoid going after the
surf castle area". Well, that was exactly where I was the day
before... funny, isn't it?

### You can bring amazing stuff in a plane

Yes! You can bring your own scanner in a plane. While it makes funny
faces during checks at the airport, it's fine. Greg had to take it because
he was finishing a comic book and had to scan and ink everything.

For the fun of it, he decided to forget to bring the USB cable. Ahah, first mission then
was to find a new USB cable in a spot where you have more surfboards than
computers. Good luck.

## Doing sport while remote working

Oh and I forget to mention that in fact... I've never been so productive
by practicing sport during the half of each day. Give it a try, you may
be surprised!
