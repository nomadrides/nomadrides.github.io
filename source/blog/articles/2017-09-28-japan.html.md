April, 1st. Cecile and I are taking off, to Japan. And no April's fool joke would have prevented us from going. I would have buried the jokers 6 feet down.

Why? Because for more than 6 years, I had been dreaming about Japan. Reading every books there are, from geopolitics to social, through arts, culture and architecture books. And of course, all the mangas too ·ï¶(√≤_√≥Àá)·ï§

With all these expectations I built up came a rather strange and disturbing question though: what if Japan is far from being the country I've dreamed about for so long?

Let me reassure you right away: Japan did not let me down in the least. It shipped and delivered, fast and strong, every single day.

Story short: **it was INCREDIBLE**.

Our trip was two-parts.
First, 1 month in Tokyo, both of us teaching part-time at [Le Wagon](http://lewagon.com/tokyo) new bootcamp here, for their very first batch (check out our students projects demo, pretty cool stuff they built).
Second, 1 month traveling through the country, to the south, until reaching Okinawa.

## What is this article's angle?

For the ones expecting a tale of our journey, I'll refer you to our journal, written by C√©cile üí™ (only French version available for now, english one may be translated, provided you guys want it).

My focus here is more onto one particular aspect of our trip: the **remote working side**.
Because we both had freelance commitments with French companies during our stay in Japan, we had to dedicate part of our time to work on these projects.

## Hail your new GOD: Pocket Wifi

One decision we did not regret one bit was to rent a [Pocket Wifi](https://www.japan-experience.com/rent-pocket-wifi-japan). This little box cost us 3‚Ç¨ per day, for a total of 161‚Ç¨ over 44 days.

It was f.....ing worth it.
Prior to our trip to Japan, I would never have guessed how much I would come to enjoy the indirect **benefits this little box would provide** us with.

In the Shinkansen, riding the bus to the beach in Okinawa, still in need to punch in some code, to reply to some emails, or just to check on random internet stuff? You can. Reliably. No sweat. No depending on some shitty mobile data provider, using buggy tethering procedures. **It just works**. And the digital freedom it allows you to enjoy my friends... Just amazing!

Picture this: anywhere we went we were able to settle down in a caf√© of our choice, and get some work done. Without any second thoughts. Just choose the place you really want to spend time working from. No need to worry about wifi connection, or anything of the sort.

Speaking of caf√©s and places to work from...

## Awesome cosy caf√©s and coworking spaces

To our westerners‚Äô eyes, Japan can often be one of the most hipster country you can think of. The art of Zen, the craft mastery videos you can find on the Internet ([Jiro dreams of Sushi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1UDS2kgqY8), among [many others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMtSc2MJLcw])), all in all, Japan can be looked on as a country of avant-garde in numbers of domains.

Sometimes it deserves its reputation, sometimes it does not.
Fortunately for us and our digital nomad lifestyle, working around town in caf√©s and coworking spaces, when it comes to these places, Japan delivers.

Some stats first: during our 2 months stay there, **we went to work in 4 caf√©s and 3 coworking spaces**.

One of this coworking space was in Himeji, the city of the [Hakuro-j√¥ castle](http://www.himejicastle.jp/en/), the White Heron. We were in the city only for the day, to visit the castle, on our way from Osaka to Hiroshima. We finished our visit early, had a couple of hours to kill before taking our next train, so we turned to our dear friend Google! Surprise, a coworking space in Himeji, who would have thought?! And a good one at that!

Here are one other coworking and one coffee place we went too, just to give you some pictures of these cools places!

## Fitting this in our shared and packed schedule

Obviously, our stay in Japan was not all about work. But still, we had some üò©

C√©cile had some work for a French startup, helping as reenforcement in their developers team, while I had just started working for a big French corporation on a internal business intelligence application.

We also wanted to **get a side-project starting**, working together on it while discovering new pieces of web technology. This project is called [HousingList](http://housing-list.com) üò¨

It‚Äôs also related to our nomad needs, maybe there will be an article about it soon...

So, now you can understand why we really enjoyed Japan‚Äôs benefits I presented before.
When you know you‚Äôre at liberty to literally stop at any cool place, and get some work done, then it becomes way easier to actually get the work done.

We only had to plan ahead a couple of days of visits, and then, quite naturally, we would end up spending some time in a caf√©, or anywhere else, and get some work done. It could also be our Airbnb or hotel room (that‚Äôs how we got Housing List started actually üòÇ).

We did not actually get around any planning methodology or anything of the sort. Sorry about that letdown üòù

We just worked when we wanted to. Empowered by this really friendly japanese environment, made of reliable and portable Wifi, and cool places to work from, literally everywhere throughout the country.

To conclude, I would say that being a remote / nomad worker is not that complex, at least on the actual working part.
Just aim to foster this environment I just described for yourself: reliable and portable internet connection, and nice places to work from.
Then the world will truly be your oyster.
