I decided to try out a completely different concept, the Startup House.
READMORE

As remote worker, I'm used to go on working sessions alone or with maximum 1-2 other workers.
But I got the opportunity to attend a Startup House and live with 15 startuppers.

## What's a Startup House?

A Startup House is a big flat or house shared with startupers where everyone is working and living there. We call it co-living.

So the idea is to join a house with our own startup project and use this exceptional environment to be focused on our project, push a ton of features and launch it.

## Budapest, the experiment

Last December, I landed in Budapest for a first try of a house full of entrepreneurs.
This was a 1 month [ephemeral project](http://startuphousebudapest.com/).

The house, in a few numbers:

* **200 m2** with 4 bedrooms & 1 living room
* **15 people**
* **6 nationalities** coming from UK, The Netherlands, France, Turkey, Belgium, Croatia
* **5+ different skills** from web developer to Turkish jewellery manufacturer including CTO, marketing consultant, coaches, etc.

### A great journey

Besides, working and living in the flat, we had many more activities:

* **Talks** organized by and for each other
* **Speakers** coming from local startups such as [EDMdesigner](http://edmdesigner.com/) and [Ustream](http://www.ustream.tv/)
* **Gym & therms** sessions (a lot!)
* **Coworking spaces** visits
* and **Budapest**, its history, districts and night life

For sure, we also hang out a lot!
For more details about Budapest, have a look at my [previous post](/blog/2016-02-17-budapest.html).

## Paris, the long-term house

The experiment in Budapest was a massive success. We met up amazing people, had some hardcore startup work and talks. In a word we had such a great experience that organizers decided to launch a new Startup House. This new one would be a long-term house in Paris.

So I crashed in this new house for a few days!

Some facts again:

* both **coliving** and **coworking** house
* **100 m2** with 3 bedrooms & 1 living room
* **10 people**
* **5+ different skills** with brand founder, graphist, developer, bootcamp student, business intelligence consultant, etc.
* **weekly events**

The concept is totally different. It looks more like a room sharing apartment than a startup retreat apartment but still for startupers.

## Will I join a startup house for a living?

I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to spend all our time in the same place. Spending 24 hours a day in the same house, all together, I don't think it's sustainable.

I like the idea of living in a startup house and meeting people there but working from somewhere else and also meeting people from other places.

### A new family

What I can say is that I joined a new family, the Startup House family. And this one is becoming bigger every day.
I'm really happy to have been part of the first edition and can't wait to visit the next ones.

What a delight to have 5+ startup house roommates per city!

Have a look at the [Startup House Coalition](http://thecoalition.io/) project. They're currently launching more cities.
