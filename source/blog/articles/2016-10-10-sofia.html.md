Back on the road, this time we're visiting Sofia!

A conference is always a nice way to convince people to join you in a remote working session. So here we were, 4 people going for remote working + 12 more people attending the conference only.

## Coworking for 2 days

As soon as I arrived, I joined [Vincent](https://twitter.com/vdaubry), a freelancer from France. Then we directly went to a first coworking space.

### SoHo Coworking

Thanks to the magic of the Internet (and especially Twitter), a third buddy called [Joni](https://twitter.com/jonihasanen) (from Finland) joined us. We discovered the lovely [SoHo Coworking](http://soho.bg/) and artistic space. It's a nice small house in the city center.

### Remote Year project

The amazing and unexpected thing is that we met people from [Remote Year](http://www.remoteyear.com/) there.

Remote Year is a project that takes 50-80 digital nomads for a one year trip around the world. For 2k USD, every month you move to a different place. They take care of flight, housing and coworking bookings.

We talked with people from very different backgrounds: a fulltime employee in digital marketing, a nurse looking for a job, a designer, etc. But they all had the same feeling: that even after only 4 months in the program, their mindset has completely changed. That's something to try, maybe.

### Betahaus coworking

Next day, still with Vincent and Joni but also with [Fabien](http://www.norydev.com/) and [Thomas](https://twitter.com/aryko), 2 new remote workers, we went to [Betahaus Sofia](http://www.betahaus.bg/en/). The place is not located in the city center but the building is amazing, with its own caf√©, 3 floors, coworking space and companies offices.

We worked from the flex desks area where we met workers from Betahaus Hamburg. That's amazing to see how remote working is a quick icebreaker.

It was inspiring to meet both Remote Year nomads and remote workers.

## Visiting Sofia

Remote working isn't only about working. It's also about discovering the city we're working in. As a [Free Walking Tour](http://freesofiatour.com/) lover, I obviously tried the one from Sofia.

Again I haven't been disappointed. We even met up with people going to the same conference as we were!

## Euruko & housing

[Euruko](http://euruko2016.org/) is the European Ruby conference. We, Ruby developers, are like a big family. Maybe that's what brought me to organize housing for the Ruby families I belong to.

For the conference nights, it turned out I set up housing for 15+ people coming from France, Belgium, Switzerland and Turkey. That was quite an incredible feat on its own!

## What next?

We're a remote working lab. Come discover Europe and different workplaces with us!

For now, I'll leave you with the picture of our one week family.
